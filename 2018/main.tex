\begin{abstract}
  Stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and differential algebraic
  equations (DAEs) with high index number are problems present in physical
  models like Brusselator and Euler-Lagrange equations with constraints.
  Stiffness detection and automatic switching algorithms will not only help
  users choose a near optimal solver for the problem, but it will also greatly
  improve the efficiency of solving ODEs by switching algorithms within the
  time domain of interest. Stiffness detection and automatic switching
  algorithms are not presently implemented for most ODE solvers except
  \texttt{LSODA}. Also, there is no open source index reduction algorithm for
  DAEs. Thus, my project aims to implement production ready stiffness detection
  and automatic switching algorithms, and index reduction algorithms for DAEs
  by the end of this summer.
\end{abstract}

\section{Motivation and The Project}
% 1) Very high level overview: why should people who don't know the subject care?
% 2) Dive in, what are the concrete problems you want to solve? Why are they interesting?
% 3) How are you going to solve them? Basically lay out what you're going to write about.
Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are very important because they arise
from many branches of science. Most of the ODEs which people encounter have no
analytical solution. Hence, people must solve them numerically. Stiff ODEs are
often produced from chemical reaction systems, electrical circuits and
discretization of diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs). Stiff ODEs
cause explicit numerical methods to fail because the ODE system forces them to
have very small time steps. Stiff ODE solvers can avoid this problem by taking
a peek at the next time step. However, this technique comes with a high cost,
which is to solve a linear or non-linear system at each step. People usually do
not know whether their ODE systems are stiff before actually solving them.
Automatic stiffness detection and switching algorithms will enable us to avoid
the hassle of choosing a correction solver for each problem by classifying the
problem type and selecting an appropriate solver automatically.

Differential algebraic equations (DAEs) arise from a wide range of problems
like multi-body and rigid body mechanics, electrical circuit design and optimal
control. Many of those problems come from Euler-Lagrange equations with
constraints. DAEs are not easy to solve because numerical methods are only
specialized for solving their low-index form, however, most of the practical
problems are not in the desired form. Hence, index reduction algorithms can
give a huge productivity boost for people who work on solving DAEs, as index
lowering procedures are not trivial.

For example, I am interested in the Brusselator --- a model that describes a
kind of autocatalysis. It is specified by the reactions
\begin{align*}
  A&\longrightarrow B\\
  2X +  Y&\longrightarrow 3X\\
  B + X&\longrightarrow Y+D\\
  X&\longrightarrow E.
\end{align*}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.5\textwidth}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{bz_rect}
  \centering
  \caption{BZ reaction}
\end{wrapfigure}
Thus, we have a PDE system which has the form of
\begin{align}
  \pdv{u}{t} &= A + u^2v - (B+1)u + \alpha \laplacian{u} \\
  \pdv{v}{t} &= Bu - u^2v + \alpha \laplacian{v}.
\end{align}
This problem is interesting, because it can be used to study pattern formation
and chemical clock reactions, e.g. Belousov--Zhabotinsky reaction (BZ
reaction), which is a nonlinear chemical oscillator. \textit{Method of lines}
is a common method for Brusselator, and it leads to a large system of stiff
ODEs. Its stiffness comes from the translation of the diffusion terms
$\laplacian u$ and $\laplacian v$.

Another mathematical model that I am interested in is rigid body dynamics.
Formulating problems in terms of manifold and local coordinates is usually very
cumbersome. One can use Lagrange multipliers to solve those kind of problems
easily, since one can write the problem as normal and only needs to add
holonomic constraints and Lagrange multipliers. For instance, the motion of a
simple pendulum in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ can be described by
\begin{align}
  x'' &= -\lambda x \\
  y'' &= -\lambda y - g \\
  x^2 + y^2 &= 1.
\end{align}
However, this system has a differentiation index of 3. Numerical methods are
not able to solve such a system. Thus, one must use indexing reaction
algorithms to transform the above into a index-1 form.

Hence, there are two projects that I propose for the Google Summer of Code
(GSoC) Program, one is \textit{stiffness detection and automatic switching
algorithms}, and the other is \textit{tooling of} \texttt{ModelingToolkit.jl}.
By the end of the program, I hope to have implemented production ready
automatic stiffness detection algorithms, intermediate representation (IR)
manipulating tools, and index reduction algorithm for differential algebraic
equations.

\subsection{Goal 1: Implement stiffness detection and automatic switching
algorithms} \label{goal1}
An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is an equality relationship among a
function $y(t)$, its independent variable $t$ and its derivatives. An $n$th
order ODE can be written as
\begin{equation}
  F(t, y(t), y'(t), \cdots, y^{(n-1)}(t)) = 0.
\end{equation}
While stiff ODEs are a kind of problem which is very hard to solve by most
explicit numerical methods, they can be solved by implicit methods like the
family of Rosenbrock methods, implicit Runge-Kutta methods or backward
differentiation formulae (BDF) without any issue. The problem is that the
methods which work well for stiff ODEs are not fast, as they have to solve for
non-linear or linear systems in each time step. Yet, most stiff problems are
not stiff throughout the whole domain of interest. This leads to the motivation
of my first project, \textit{stiffness detection and automatic switching
algorithms}. Conventionally, one uses only a single algorithm to solve for the
entire domain of interest. Thus, one is forced to use a stiff algorithm,
although there is only a very small interval in the domain that is stiff. The
auto-switching algorithm can solve this dilemma and raise the efficiency of
solving ODEs, because stiff algorithms will only be applied to the stiff part
of the domain, and non-stiff algorithms will solve the rest of the problem
quickly. This project is beneficial for most people who use the
\textit{JuliaDiffEq} ecosystem, because it removes the burden of having to test
multiple algorithms for one problem and chose the more efficient one. It can
also help to save computation time for ODE systems, e.g. time stepping of a PDE
discretization.

\subsubsection{Implementation Details}
Higham and Trefethen~\cite{stiffode} pointed out that an ODE system is stiff
when the pseudospectrum of its $J$ has large radii while it has a small abscissa,
where $J$ denotes a Jacobian matrix. Computing the pseudospectra of a linear
operator is very costly, so in practice, it makes sense to only calculate the norm
or the approximated largest eigenvalue of $J$.

The simplest automatic stiffness detection on explicit Runge-Kutta algorithms
is proposed by Ernst Hairer~\cite{hairer2}. One can use
\begin{equation}
  \abs{\lambda} = \frac{\norm{f(y+v, t)-f(y, t)}}{\norm{v}}
\end{equation}
to approximate the dominant eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix of the function
$f(y, t)$ when $\norm{v}$ is small. For explicit Runge-Kutta methods like
Dormand-Prince and Tsitouras $5/4$ pairs, there is the relation $c_6 = c_7 =
1$. Hence, one can use
\begin{equation}
  \varrho = \frac{\norm{k_7-k_6}}{\norm{g_7-k_6}}\qqtext{where } k_i = f(g_i,
  t_0 + c_i\cdot \Delta t)
\end{equation}
to produce a reasonable approximation of the most significant eigenvalue.
Naturally, one can classify a problem to be stiff when $\Delta
t\cdot\varrho/S \ll 1$. Where $S$ is the width of the stability domain of the
Runge-Kutta algorithm. Currently, the implementation reads:

\begin{lstlisting}
g6 = uprev+dt*(a61*k1+a62*k2+a63*k3+a64*k4+a65*k5)
k6 = f(g6, p, t+dt)
g7 = u
rho = integrator.opts.internalnorm(k7 - k6)/
      integrator.opts.internalnorm(g7 - g6)
stiffness = rho*dt/3.3
\end{lstlisting}

Here is a demonstration of this automatic stiffness detection method with the
infamous Dormand-Prince $5/4$ integrator. The ODEs that the integrator solves
are
\begin{align}
  y'_1 &= y_2\\
  y'_2 &= ((1-y_1^2)y_2-y_1) / \varepsilon
\end{align}
where $\varepsilon$ is $0.003$.

% In the stiffness detection and switching details, you laid out how we can do
% the detection in one case, how do we detect in the stiff methods?
%
% And what are some ideas for switching algorithms?
%
% Now is a good time to sit down and think about (read about) a few different
% switching algorithms (given the stiffness results, how do we know when to
% switch?), and propose a few.

It is trivial to check the stiffness of an ODE system in an implicit method,
because it already calculates the Jacobian matrix. One can bound the most
significant eigenvalue by the infinity norm $\norm{J}_{\infty}$, and it is
cheap to calculate an infinity norm.

Switching algorithm can be done by the \texttt{CompositeAlgorithm} type. It has
an API of \texttt{CompositeAlgorithm(algtup,choice\_function)}, where
\texttt{algtup} is a tuple of algorithms, and \texttt{choice\_function} is the
switching strategy. Thus, I can implement the switching algorithm by imposing a
strategy which depends on the stiffness, e.g. the algorithm switches to
\texttt{Rodas5} (a 5th order A-stable stiffly stable Rosenbrock method) after
hitting 15 successive stiff test positives from \texttt{DP5} or \texttt{Tsit5}
and switches back to explicit Runge-Kutta after receiving 15 successive stiff
test negative.

\subsection{Goal 2: Tooling for \texttt{ModelingToolkit.jl}}
% You should explain more ModelingToolkit.jl tooling
% there's a few other things we'll need for the DAE portion
% for example, how do we know where all of the derivatives are?
% For now we've been assuming they are on the left, but that might not be true.
% They may not be sorted either. So we may need some manipulation routines and
% a few simplification routines before doing the index reduction.
\texttt{ModelingToolkit.jl}~\cite{modelingtoolkit} is an intermediate
representation (IR) of computational graphs for scientific computing problems.
Every domain specific language (DSL) has a stage of lowering expressions into a
form of intermediate representation. \texttt{ModelingToolkit.jl} is a compiler
for scientific computing DSLs. My second goal during this GSoC project is to
implement expression parsing tools and utilities for IR manipulation in the
repository. For instance, currently, this package assumes that the term with
the highest order of differentiation is on the left hand side of the equation,
but it might not be true. Hence, a sorting transformation is necessary to
canonicalize a system of differential equations. Another example of tooling is
that the user Borisov~\cite{parsing} requested an expression parsing tool of
the following form.
\begin{lstlisting}
ex = quote
    v1 = k1*A*comp1
    dA = -v1/comp1
    dB = v1/comp1
end
params = (:k1, :comp1)
depend_vars = (:A, :B)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Goal 3: Implement DAE index reduction algorithms}
My third goal is to implement index reduction algorithms for differential
algebraic equations (DAEs). DAEs arise naturally from Euler-Lagrange
equations with constraints and many modeling problems, and its general form is
\begin{equation}
  F(t, \vec{x}, \frac{d\vec{x}}{dt}) = \vec{0}.
\end{equation}
However, numerical DAE solvers can only handle Hessenberg index-1 and
Hessenberg index-2 forms,
\begin{align}
  &\textbf{Hessenberg index-1}
  \begin{dcases}
    y_i' &= f_i(t,y_i,z_i)\\
    0 &= g_i(t,y,z)
  \end{dcases}\\
  &\textbf{Hessenberg index-2}
  \begin{dcases}
    y'_i &= f_i(t,y_i,z_i)\\
    0 &= g_i(t,y)
  \end{dcases}
\end{align}
so one has to reduce the index of the DAE to index-1 or index-2 form. Yet, it
is difficult and cumbersome to reduce the indices of a DAE system by hand. The
\texttt{ModelingToolkit.jl} package has enough information about a DAE system,
because it has its own computational graph of the system. This project benefits
people who work on modelings and dynamical systems when the solutions' local
coordinates are complicated and not trivial to convert to.

\subsection{Stretch Goals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Implement utilities for plotting Poincar\'e sections.
  \item Implement \texttt{IIF1} and \texttt{IIF2} methods for solving
    semi-linear partial differential equations (PDEs)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Potential Hurdles}
% I don't think I gave the whole rundown, but the general idea is that it's best
% to make very few clear API "entrance points". It's much easier to document
% "here's all of the diffeqsystem->diffeqsystem functions" then it is to have a
% whole load of functions that act on different objects.

% That's a potential hurdle with the ModelingToolkit.jl part: trying to find out
% a clean API that's simplified and accessible, and documenting it in a minimal
% way.

The \texttt{ModelingToolkit.jl} portion presents a specific hurdle. It may be
tedious determining a clean way to implement API that is simple, accessible and
that requires minimal documentation. I believe that I can overcome this hurdle
by learning from my potential mentors'--- Jiahao and Chris'---suggestions. For
instance, when I was implementing the order reduction algorithm for systems of
ODEs, Chris taught me that this kind of algorithms should be implemented as a
transformation that is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:map}
  f: \texttt{DiffEqSystem}\mapsto \texttt{DiffEqSystem},
\end{equation}
so that it fits into the design of the \texttt{ModelingToolkit.jl} package, and
makes it more flexible and extendible~\cite{i49}. Such design choice helps to
make a clear API. It is much cleaner to list all the functions which have the
map~(\ref{eq:map}) then it is to have numerous functions that act on different
objects in the documentation.

In addition, I may also struggle to use \texttt{Git}. In the past, I have
accidentally messed up a pull request by a bad \texttt{git rebase} command.
However, I am confident that I can subdue this problem by being extra careful
when I merge or rebase in a \texttt{Git} repository.

\subsection{Potential Mentors}
Jiahao Chen (\texttt{@jiahao}) is going to be my primary mentor, and
Christopher Rackauckas (\texttt{@ChrisRackauckas}) is going to my secondary
mentor.

\section{Milestones}
There are several aspects of my project I need to consider such as features,
API usability and documentation. I will initially prioritize robustness over
everything else, as accuracy and reliablilty is critical in numerical analysis
software. I will achieve robustness by adding extensive tests and benchmarks
for all of my pull requests. I will then shift my attention to API usability,
as it is also important for software to be user-friendly. After I stabilize the
API, I will move my focus to documentation. I will provide the standard
documentation at \url{http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/}, and will also
include tutorials in the \texttt{DiffEqTutorials.jl} repository. Here is my
tentative plan for the GSoC project.

\paragraph{Community Bonding: April 5 --- May 14}
I will read more literature regarding stiffness, and discuss possible
implementations with my mentors.

\paragraph{First Milestone --- Stiffness Detection Algorithms: May 14 --- June
11}
I should have implemented most of the stiffness detection algorithms by June
11, and most of the methods switching firework should also be finished as well.
At this stage, I will be ready for dive into benchmarks, and try to find the
best methods switching strategy.

\paragraph{First Evaluation: June 11 --- June 15}
At this point, I should have completed my first goal~\ref{goal1}, and I should
clean up the code that I have produced during the last period.

\paragraph{Second Milestone --- \texttt{ModelingToolkit.jl} IR Tooling: June 15
--- July 9}
I will turn my focus to the \texttt{ModelingToolkit.jl} repository at this
stage, but I will still try to optimize the methods switching strategy that was
completed in the previous milestone. I will also fix some bugs in the strategy
and the algorithms, since after stiffness detection and automatic switching
algorithms are tagged in the \texttt{OrdinaryDiffEq.jl} repository, users will
perhaps file bug reports about those algorithms. I should have finished
expression parsing by July 9.

\paragraph{Second Evaluation: July 9 --- July 13}
I am going to clean up my code in the \texttt{ModelingToolkit.jl} repository.
After filling the second evaluation form, I should have finished all my GSoC
goals at this step.

\paragraph{Third Milestone --- DAE index reduction algorithms \& Stretch Goals:
July 13 -- August 6}
I am going to work on DAE index reduction algorithms and stretch goals at this
stage. DAE index reduction algorithms are not very complicated and I think I
should have time to work on my stretch goals if everything goes well.

\paragraph{Finial Evaluation: August 6 --- August 14}
I will complete my finial evaluation report and clean up my code in this final
stage of the GSoC project.
